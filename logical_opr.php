/**
Logical operator give result in true or false, it is use in if condition. if we want to use more than one condition in if statement then we need to use logical operators. there are six
logical operators

&& AND operator (if both conditions are true then it will return true.)

|| OR operator (if one condition is true and second is false then it will return true and if both true then it will return true and if both are false then it will reurn false)

! NOT operator (it will give vice versa result if true then it will return false)

XOR Exclusive OR operator (if both conditions are true and false then it will return false but if one condition is true and second is false then it will give true.)
